# Hi, I'm Tom Lodge
<img src="banner.png" alt="banner"/>
I am a research fellow at the University of Nottingham's <a href="https://www.horizon.ac.uk/">Horizon Digital Economy research institute</a>. I've worked on a huge variety of interesting projects,  that have touched upon a wide range of technologies. My main skill is as a coder/developer, but I love design too, and have built plenty of hardware prototypes along the way. Please feel free to take a look at my projects and my fuller website <a href="https://www.tomlodge.info">here</a>.
